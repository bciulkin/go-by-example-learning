### Matchmaking assumptions:

Team should consist of:
1x tank
2x dps
2x support

If player is looking for a team longer than 2 minutes, you allow 150 difference.
If player is looking for a team longer than 3 minutes, you allow 200 difference.
If player is looking for a team longer than 4 minutes, you allow 250 difference.
If player is looking for a team longer than 5 minutes, you allow 300 difference.
